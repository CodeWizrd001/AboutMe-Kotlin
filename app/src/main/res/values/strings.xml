    <string name="bio">
        Anthony Edward Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers,
        and the former CEO of Stark Industries.
        \n\nA brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described
        as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist.
        \nWith his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge,
        Stark was one of the world\'s most powerful men following the deaths of his parents
        and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan,
        while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles.
        \n\nWith his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit
        which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against
        terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark.
        \n\nStark enjoyed the fame that came with his
        new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly revealing himself as Iron Man.
